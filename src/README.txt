This is “What's your Wager!”
Each player starts with 10 dice. Each turn, each player will decide how many dice to roll.
The player with the highest roll will get points equal to the total number of dice rolled that turn.
If there is a tie, no one gets points.
The game is over when one person runs out of dice, and any leftover dice will be converted to points.
(Each leftover die will be worth one point for its owner)

There should be a display for the number of dice left for each player (As dice, not a number)
There should be a display for the number of points each player has (In numbers)
There should be a new window and a win statement when the game is over (P1 or P2 wins!)

It throws an error when first run, but this shouldn't stop it from running
If it does, try running again, and it should run
(This is a problem with the original game and the way in which the dice and rolls were created)
